## Abstract
Clustering plays a critical role in data analytics and mining with the emergence of big data. Identifying the underlying structures and patterns to form groups of data in an unsupervised setting is important to derive useful insights. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of different clustering methods on multiple datasets to evaluate their performance, strengths, and caveats in different scenarios. The objective is to study what type methods are useful in varying situations with the help of thorough discussion and analysis.

## Introduction
For a technical review of clustering methods, we have analysed four types of unsupervised clustering methods:
1. K-Means/K-Means++ Clustering
2. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
3. DBSCAN Clustering
4. Mean Shift Clustering

For analysis, two datasets are used `Iris` and `Spiral`. The Iris dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository and the Spiral Dataset is synthetically generated.

The rationale behind the two chosen datasets is that the Iris dataset is based on real-life properties of three types of species of flowers. Therefore, the three species are naturally separable from each other into different clusters. On the other hand, the Spiral dataset is synthetically generated and its spiral nature makes the data extremely hard for clustering algorithms to separate into different clusters. Spiral is deliberately chosen to illustrate the weaknesses and caveats of some of the clustering methods.
